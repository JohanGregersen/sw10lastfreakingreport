Usage-based insurance (UBI) is currently surfacing both in research and within insurance companies. There are however a lack of actual products, with those that exist being experimental and limited to small customer segments. Insurance companies are showing a clear interest in entering the market, but UBI as a product is complex, and little research exists when it comes to fully featured products. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and experimentation on Drive-LaB, a fully functional UBI platform. Drive-LaB lets users collect spatio-temporal data with their smartphone. The system uses this data to evaluate risks associated with driving style and environment. Drive-LaB is supported by a complex backend system featuring an advanced data warehouse. On the frontend it offers an easy-to-use interface, letting users see detailed statistics on driven trips. Drive-LaB has been used for experiments, collecting more than 13.000 kilometers worth of data. This data has been used to validate the platform and display how the system performs in a realistic setting.
