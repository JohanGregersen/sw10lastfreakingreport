Usage based car insurance is beginning surface both in research and within insurance companies. There are however a lack of actual products, with those that exist being experimental and limited to small customer segments. Insurance companies are showing a clear interest in entering the market, but UBI as a product is complex, and little research exists when it comes to fully featured products. In this paper, we describe the design, build and experimentation of Drive-LaB, a fully featured UBI product. Drive-LaB tracks time and location in order to judge risks associated with driving style and environment. The system is supported by a complex backend system featuring an advanced data warehouse. On the front-end however, the system offers an easy-to-use interface for location tracking. Furthermore, users are able to see detailed statistics about their trips.
