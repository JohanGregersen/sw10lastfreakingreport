P. HÃ¤ndel et. al. discusses the technology aspects of smartphone-based telematics, and highlights challenges in using smartphones as measurement probes\cite{art:insurtelematics}. They further suggest a number of metrics to differentiate between trips, and discuss the relevance and observability of these. The work is however only concerned with the smartphone and its possibilities. It does not concern itself with implementing a system to support usage based insurance.
