\subsection{System Experiments}\label{subsec:expsystem}
An important aspect of the Drive-LaB experiments, is to validate if there is an impact on tripscores caused by the diversity of users' smartphones. In the context of usage-based insurance, users should be treated equally, which relies entirely upon their smartphone and its GPS antenna. Under optimal conditions, two smartphones logging the same trip, should report identical tripscores. Such an analysis can be quite extensive, involving an entire market of smartphones and different versions of GPS antennas. Instead, a small scale test was performed. The test contained a selection of different smartphones to indicate whether Drive-LaB is vulnerable to GPS inaccuracy. 

The test will be referred to as an applicability test. An applicability test will confirm whether or not smartphones are capable of scoring trips equally. It was conducted by setting up five different smartphones and two high quality GPS trackers\citep{quality_gps_device} in the same car, and record the trip concurrently with all devices. For the system to be applicable for usage-based insurance, the smartphones needs to report identical tripscores, and the routes should to be near-identical to those recorded by the high quality GPS trackers.

With the seven devices, four trips were completed driving around in northern Jutland, in the vicinity of Aalborg. Raw data from the trips can be seen in Tables \ref{exp1trip1}, \ref{exp1trip2}, \ref{exp1trip3} and \ref{exp1trip4} in Appendices. A summary of the tripscores for each device, can be seen in Table \ref{tab:smartphone_test_one}.

When examining trip 1 from Table \ref{tab:smartphone_test_one} which has a length of approximately 36.200 meters, two smartphones and one high quality GPS scores between 37.000-40.000. This corresponds to a good score. But the remaining four devices disagree with varying severity. The worst is the Huawei Y330, which scores 81.819. The Huawei Y330 however only logs 23\% of the average GPS coordinates compared to the other devices. The Huawei continues this trend throughout the test, and seems unfit for use in usage-based insurance. Another alarming result in trip 1 is the degree to which the two high quality GPS devices disagrees. One scores 37.910 while the other scores 69.956 - a 84\% increase.

Trip 2 in Table \ref{tab:smartphone_test_one} has a length of approximately 28.200 meters. On this trip, one of the high quality GPS devices failed to log the entire trip. For the remaining devices, two  range from 27.750-28.750 in tripscore. The noteworthy result compared to trip 1 is, that the devices with a low tripscore are not the same as those in trip 1.

The same pattern occur with trip 3 from Table \ref{tab:smartphone_test_one}, which has a length of approximately 13.400 meters. This time, four devices gets a score ranging from 16.500-24.050, which are somewhat similar. The last three devices got a much higher tripscore, the highest being 85.139, approximately 535\% above the trip-length, and it was logged by one of the high quality GPS devices. To highlight the disagreement between the two high quality GPS devices, the other device got a score of 20.981. 

The pattern is broken with trip 4 from Table \ref{tab:smartphone_test_one}, where all devices range between 13.000-27.550. While scores are still diverse, it is significantly better compared it to trip 3. For this trip, the worst device scored approximately 91\% above the length from this trip, compared to 535\% in trip 3. The high quality GPS devices also score similarly on trip 4 with a result of 23.917 and 27.075 respectively. 

When analyzing the results from this test, the immediate thought may be to throw away the smartphone as usage-based insurance component. Concern about accuracy, integrity, availability and continuity of service in standalone GPS receivers is also raised in other articles  \citep{art:smartphones_for_monitoring_and_ubi} \citep{art:survey_mobile_phone_sensing} \citep{art:insurtelematics} \citep{art:in-car_positioning_technologies} \citep{art:challenges_smartphone_ubi}. But two other factors may have influenced the results in Table \ref{tab:smartphone_test_one}. The first factor is GPS interference, in which case the test setup could have changed the results. For the experiment, all GPS devices were in close proximity of each other. All devices were placed in a fabric container and placed in the front of the car near the windshield. This could affect the GPS receivers by interfering with each other \citep{art:gps_interference_two} \citep{art:gps_interference_one}. This position was decided upon, because a common reference point was valued in the applicability test. One article provides concrete results in terms of coverage from smartphone GPS receivers, and during a 1 hour and 15 minutes trip, 6 hard brakes were detected with an OBD device inside the car. A total of seven smartphones was brought on this trip, and they had a coverage in the interval of 60\% to 99.7\% when detecting these brakes \citep{art:insurtelematics}. This states that smartphones are indeed vulnerable to inaccuracy. Coverage means the degree to which the smartphones align with the control-unit, in this case the OBD. The test also included outliers, false positives, and indeterminable which causes the percentages to be skewed.

The second factor is the use of TrackMatching, a third party software for map-matching spatio-temporal trajectories \citep{trackmatch}.. TrackMatch attempts to map-match a series of points to the OpenStreetMap road network, and output the entire route by segments and map-adjusted GPS points. The algorithm TrackMatch uses to map-match coordinates are however unknown. No module was implemented to oversee this readjusting, so this influence cannot be changed.

It was decided to repeat the applicability test and eliminate the GPS interference as much as possible. For the second test, the GPS devices were arranged in the car with as much distance as possible between them. The possible margin of error by using a separated reference point was disregarded. The Huawei Y330 was also omitted.

The test results shown in Table \ref{tab:smartphone_test_two} once again shows a considerable difference when comparing the two high quality GPS devices. But the difference is decreased substantially compared to the first test, which signifies that some external influence may have been affecting the devices. Looking at the raw data in Tables \ref{exp1trip1} through \ref{exp2trip4}, an observation is that their behavior is consistent. When looking at the amount of accelerations, brakes and jerks, one device consistently counts more than others. BT-\#1 counted a total of 1529 of these events, whereas BT-\#2 counted a total of 3894. That is 191.13 events per trip on average for BT-\#1, and 486.75 events per trip on average for BT-\#2. This generalization of more events registered by BT-\#2 are present in both tests. This signifies that it may not be able to conclude any comparison between these two devices, because they deliver such different results.

The results from Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Galaxy S5 and BT-\#1 from the second test, actually compares well to the results they provided in the first test. There is an influence in the driving style, but both tests was performed by the same driver. The driver attempted to follow his personal driving style during both tests. Additionally, traffic may also influence the results in the tests, but the tests was performed in a similar time-period, both on a weekday. 

The remaining devices disagrees with their results from the first test to the second test, for some of the trips. When looking at the overall result from both tests, the system is not currently applicable for usage-based insurance. This is due to the diversity in tripscores for similar trips, making it unfair for policyholders. While several articles have raised concern about the GPS receivers, some also suggested ways of supporting the raw data with model-based signal processing and an outlier rejection scheme \citep{art:smartphones_for_monitoring_and_ubi} \citep{art:insurtelematics} \citep{art:challenges_smartphone_ubi}. This would make the trajectories more stringent, and possibly eliminate falsely positive delinquencies caused by a jumpy GPS coordinate. It is considered a good next step to design and implement such a scheme into the Drive-LaB system. This scheme could potentially make each GPS receiver more consistent. If it could be achieved that every GPS device produces reproducible results, a calibration mechanism could eliminate the diversity caused by different GPS devices. This would ultimately cleanse the instability about accuracy, integrity, availability and continuity of service from standalone GPS receivers, and make the system robust enough to apply entirely to usage-based insurance.
