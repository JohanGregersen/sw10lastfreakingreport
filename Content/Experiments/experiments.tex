\section{EXPERIMENTS}\label{sec:experiments}

The following section is a collection of experiments. Firstly a description of the data collection used as base for the experiments, and explaining the policy used. The next section is describing a system experiment, testing whether smartphones are suitable GPS devices for a usage-based insurance. Following is a test of the metrics -whether the metrics are correlating with each other. This is done by calculating the Pearson correlation between the metric scores, and analyzing the results. The section following is a experiment on user profiling. The experiments discusses whether the metrics chosen are enough to create a telling user profile and tell users apart -with risk assessment in mind. Lastly, a section on a user experiment where 10 drivers consecutively use the system for a test period of roughly one month. This test was to test the entirety of the system, and the concept of usage-based insurance.
