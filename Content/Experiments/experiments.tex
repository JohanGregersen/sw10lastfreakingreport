\section{EXPERIMENTS}\label{sec:experiments}

The following section contains a collection of experiments. First is an introductory description of the data collection used as basis for the experiments, followed by an explanation of the policy used. The next section is a description of a system experiment, testing whether smartphones are suitable GPS devices for a usage-based insurance. Following is a test of the metrics used in Drive-LaB, to test whether they correlate with each other. This is done by calculating the Pearson correlation between the metric scores, and analyzing the results. The section following contains an experiment on driver profiling. With the experiments follows a discussion of whether the metrics chosen are sufficient. Optimally, it should be possible to create a characterizing driver profile and differentiate among the drivers with risk assessment in mind. Lastly, a section describes a user experiment involving 10 drivers who used Drive-LaB consecutively for a test period of roughly one month. This experiment was used to test the entire system, and the concepts of usage-based insurance from a business perspective with real users.
