\section{EXPERIMENTS}\label{sec:experiments}

The following section contains a collection of experiments. Section \ref{sec:datacollection} is an introductory description of the data collection used as basis for the experiments, followed by an explanation of the policy used. Section \ref{subsec:expsystem} is a description of a system experiment, testing whether smartphones are suitable GPS devices for a usage-based insurance. Following is a test of the metrics used in Drive-LaB, to test whether they correlate with each other. It is described in Section \ref{subsec:pearsoncorrelation}. This is done by calculating the Pearson correlation between the metric scores, and analyzing the results. Section \ref{subsec:userprofiling} contains an experiment on driver profiling. With the experiments follows a discussion of whether the metrics chosen are sufficient. Optimally, it should be possible to create a characterizing driver profile and differentiate among the drivers with risk assessment in mind. Lastly, Section \ref{subsec:userexp} describes a user experiment involving 10 drivers who used Drive-LaB consecutively for a test period of roughly one month. This experiment was used to test the entire system, and the concepts of usage-based insurance from a business perspective with real users.
