\section{EXPERIMENTS}\label{sec:experiments}

The following section is a collection of experiments. First is a introductory description of the data collection used as basis for the experiments, followed by an explanation of the policy used. The next section is a description of a system experiment, testing whether smartphones are suitable GPS devices for a usage-based insurance. Following is a test of the metrics -whether the metrics are correlating with each other. This is done by calculating the Pearson correlation between the metric scores, and analyzing the results. The section following is an experiment on driver profiling. The experiments discusses whether the metrics chosen are enough to create a characterizing driver profile and be able to differentiate among the drivers -with risk assessment in mind. Lastly, a section on a user experiment where 10 drivers consecutively used the system for a test period of roughly one month. This experiment was used to test the entire system, and the concepts of usage-based insurance from a business perspective with actual continuous users.
