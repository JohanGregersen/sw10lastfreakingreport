For a system to support usage based insurance, two overall components are required. A client application supporting the collection and display of data, and a backend capable of storing all necessary information about users and how they drive. The implemented system however utilizes a second server in between the client and the storage server. This server extracts all required information from the raw location data and passes it on to the storage server. Communication between the components are done using JSON through REST APIs hosted on both servers.
