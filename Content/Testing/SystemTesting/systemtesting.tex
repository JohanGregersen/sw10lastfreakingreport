System testing

An important factor to validate is the impact on trip-scores caused by the diversity of users' smart-phones. In a usage based insurance context, users needs to be treated equally, which relies entirely upon their smart-phone and the GPS device inside. E.g. two smart-phones logging the same trip, should report the same trip-score. Such an analysis can be quite extensive, involving an entire market of smart-phones and different versions of GPS devices. Instead, a small applicability test will tell whether this system is vulnerable to GPS inaccuracy. 

An applicability test was conducted by bringing 5 different smart-phones and 2 high quality GPS trackers into the same car, and recording the trip with all entities at the same time. If the system is applicable for usage based insurance, the smart-phones needs to report the same trip-scores, and the route needs to be highly similar to those recorded by the high quality GPS trackers.

There are a couple of issues regarding this applicability test.
